This project demonstrates the implementation of the Adams-Moulton Method, a numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

### Algorithm: Adams-Moulton Method 

1. **Initialize Values:**
   - Start with the initial conditions. These are the starting values for the independent variable \( x_0 \) and the dependent variable \( y_0 \).
   - Choose a step size, \( h \), which determines how frequently you calculate the next values of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Set an endpoint for the independent variable \( x \), called \( x_end\).

2. **Predictor Step:**
   - Using the current value of \( y \), estimate the value of the dependent variable \( y_pred\) at the next step using a simple method (Eulerâ€™s method). This is the "predicted" value of \( y \) at the next \( x \).

3. **Corrector Step:**
   - After predicting the next value of \( y \), correct this prediction by considering the slope of the function at both the current point and the predicted point.
   - This gives a more accurate estimate of the next value of \( y \) based on both the current and predicted slopes.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Move to the next step by updating the value of \( x \) (incrementing it by the step size \( h \)).
   - Use the corrected value of \( y \) as the new value for the next iteration.
   - Repeat the prediction and correction steps until you reach the endpoint \( x_end\).

5. **Output Results:**
   - After iterating through all the steps, output the calculated values of \( x \) and their corresponding \( y \) values.
   - Optionally, plot the values of \( x \) and \( y \) to visualize the solution.
